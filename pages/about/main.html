		    <p>Cogl aims to give developers high performance access to modern graphics
		    hardware, exposing the low level features in a portable API that runs on
		    Linux, Windows, OSX, Android and now even in your web browser.</p>

		    <p>With Cogl we've tried to re-think GPU graphics API design and - for
		    example - depart from the state machine style of OpenGL, instead letting
		    you directly manage and access your state via objects. The upshot of this
		    approach is that it's easy to write orthogonal and re-usable rendering
		    components with Cogl.</p>

		    <p>Cogl aims to really be useful for graphics work which means
		    more than just raw access to the GPU. Cogl provides the essential
		    utilities needed to really get things done, such as math utilities,
		    texture utilities, text rendering, video integration, gles2 integration,
		    path tessellation. Most of these utilities are optional though, so you
		    can choose to use as much or as little as is necessary for your work.</p>

		    <p>We are currently working our way towards a Cogl 2.0 release, so if you
		    are interested in GPU graphics, perhaps with some experience using
		    OpenGL or D3D for game development then now is a good time to get
		    involved and give us feedback about how the API is coming along.</p>
