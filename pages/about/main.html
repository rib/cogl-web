		    <p>Cogl is a 3D graphics + utilities API, roughly comparable to
			OpenGL[ES] and Direct3D.</p>

		    <p>Cogl aims to give developers high performance access to 3D graphics
		    hardware, exposing the low level features of modern graphics hardware
		    using a portable API that runs on Linux, Windows, OSX and soon
		    Android.</p>

		    <p>With Cogl we've tried to re-think 3D graphics API design and, for
		    example, depart from the state machine style of OpenGL, instead letting
		    you directly manage and access your state via objects and interfaces
		    that those objects implement. The top-level Context object is basically
		    just a sandbox for memory management purposes whose state doesn't
		    directly affect rendering and the upshot of this approach is that it's
		    easy to write totally orthogonal and re-usable rendering components
		    with Cogl.</p>

		    <p>Cogl is implemented in the C programming language, but we'd like to
		    provide bindings for everyone's favourite language too.</p>

		    <p>We are currently working our way towards a Cogl 2.0 release, (we're
		    hoping it will be in good shape around the summer of 2012) so if you
		    are interested in 3D graphics, perhaps with some experience using
		    OpenGL or D3D then now is a great time to get involved and give us
		    feedback about how the design is coming along.<p>
