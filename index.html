	<p>Cogl is a 3D graphics + utilities API, roughly comparable to
	OpenGL[ES] and Direct3D.</p>

	<p>Cogl aims to give developers high performance access to 3D graphics
	hardware, exposing the low level features of modern graphics hardware
	using a portable API that runs on Linux, Windows, OSX and soon
	Android.</p>

	<p>With Cogl we've tried to re-think 3D graphics API design and, for
	example, depart from the state machine style of OpenGL, instead letting
	you directly manage and access your state via objects and interfaces
	that those objects implement. The top-level Context object is basically
	just a sandbox for memory management purposes whose state doesn't
	directly affect rendering and the upshot of this approach is that it's
	easy to write totally orthogonal and re-usable rendering components
	with Cogl.</p>
	
	<p>Cogl is implemented in the C programming language, but we'd like to
	provide bindings for everyone's favourite language too.</p>

	<p>We are currently working our way towards a Cogl 2.0 release, (we're
	hoping it will be in good shape around the summer of 2012) so if you
	are interested in 3D graphics, perhaps with some experience using
	OpenGL or D3D then now is a great time to get involved and give us
	feedback about how the design is coming along.<p>
